At the start of a Blackjack game, the players and the dealer receive two cards each.
The players' cards are normally dealt face up, while the dealer has one face down (called the hole card)
and one face up. The best possible Blackjack hand is an opening deal of an ace with any ten-point card.

The house advantage of this game is derived from several rules that favour the dealer.
The most significant of these is that the player must act before the dealer,
allowing the player to bust and lose their bet before the dealer plays.

Blackjack is played with a standard international deck of cards with the Jokers removed, leaving 52 cards.
Blackjack is offered with 3 decks in this case.

Card Values
When playing Blackjack the numeral cards 2 to 10 have their face values, Jacks, Queens and Kings are valued at 10,
and Aces can have a value of either 1 or 11. The Ace is always valued at 11 unless that would result in the hand
going over 21, in which case it is valued as 1.

A starting hand of a 10 valued card and an Ace is called a Blackjack or natural and beats all hands other than another Blackjack.
If both the player and dealer have Blackjack, the result is a push (tie): neither the player nor the bank wins and the bet is
returned to the player.

Stand
If the player is happy with the total they’ve been dealt they can stand, taking no further action and passing to the next player.
The player can take this action as long as their hand total is not more than 21.

Hit
If the player wishes to take another card they signal. A single card is then played face up onto their hand. If the hand total is less than 21
the player can choose to Hit again or Stand. If the total is 21 the hand automatically stands. If the total is
over 21 the hand is bust, the player’s bet is taken by the house and the turn to act passes to the next player.
